## Development

```
git clone git@github.com:ParalelnaPolisKE/web.git

* `npm run build` - builds production-ready site
* `npm run format` - corrects coding standards
* `npm run serve` - starts local HTML server for testing

### Coding Standards

Please, keep the coding standards defined by [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) and those handled with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - `npm run format` could be used to format the code automatically.
